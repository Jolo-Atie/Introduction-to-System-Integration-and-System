# Introduction-to-System-Integration-and-Architecture
My Expectations to this Subject

Hello Sir! I'm Jolo G. Atie, as I walk my journey through this program, this is my first time hearing or encountering this course so I barely have any idea on what will be tackled as the time goes by. However, I expect that this course will provide necessary lessons and information that I can use in the future as I work.

Furthermore, I expect that the lessons and activities will be taught to us that will give clear understanding of the basic concepts system architecture and integration. Having a clear understanding will surely help us in tackling real-life scenarios with much knowledge and confidence.

Lastly, I expect that this course and our interactions will be fun and exciting as we tackle the lessons from time to time and provide vast knowledge and understanding in the concepts of system integration and concepts.
